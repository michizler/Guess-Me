This is a user-friendly _Guessing Game_ created using Python. Almost like *Hangman*, a user here 
can select a difficulty and lose lives if a guess is wrong. In event all lives is lost,
it's gameover.

Levels:

*Easy*

*Medium*

*Hard*

*Legend*

*Wizard*

Try it out! Most don't get past the _Legend_ level. As usual, my contact (brightuzosike@gmail.com)
is available for questions, suggestions and adjustments.
